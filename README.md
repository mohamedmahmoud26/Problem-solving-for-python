#Problem Solving For Python
For Problem(9)
The function expects two sorted lists as inputs. The order of elements in each list matters, Use two pointers (i and j) to track the current position in each list while comparing element.
After one list is fully traversed, the other list might still have elements. Use extend to add these elements directly to the result, est with empty lists, lists of different lengths, and lists with duplicate values to ensure the function works in all scenarios This approach has a time complexity of O(n+m), where 𝑛and 𝑚 are the lengths of the two lists. It's efficient for sorted inputs.
